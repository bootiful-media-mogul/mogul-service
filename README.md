## TODO

- Show the date and time of a given episode on the edit episode page. As it stands, there's no way to know when an
  episode was published.
- Build a program to import the old episodes to the new podcast system; it’s time for this thing to earn its keep and
  for me to get off the old SQL DB. I'm paying DigitalOcean, might as well leverage it!
- Build a transcription integration flow that sends an .mp3 to Whisper (which I need to deploy) and then returns the
  text from the audio (use a Spring Integration gateway perhaps?).
- Build a way to manage channels (YouTube channels) so that I can configure credentials for SpringSourceDev and
  CoffeeSoftware and then _import_ the videos from those channels. Then I can link those to the actual source videos.
  Basically, I'll have a way to upload a video, which will in turn dump it into S3 and then run a process (using
  JobRunr?) to strip the audio from the video and then send the audio to the transcription service. The result will be
  that the transcript from the video gets attached to the video. I can then edit that in an AI text composition panel.
- I should be able to get the audio from a produced podcast and then send that to the transcription service as well.
- It should be possible, therefore, to have a button to 'produce' a new blog from the transcript and then use AI tools
  to work on the transcript and turn it into a blog.

## Useful Queries

- Make sure we didn't inadvertently create a `managed_file` that has no link to something in the graph.

## Google Cloud SQL

I'm using Google Cloud's Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL. It's pretty neat, but it has some weird nuances around how to connect
to it. They almost don't want you to connect to it. I set it up with both a private and a public IP. If you want to
connect to it locally use `prod_db_2.sh`. It's using the _public_ IP. However, for production purposes, I need to use
the _private_ IP. I also had to add the netowkr
